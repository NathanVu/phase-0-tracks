<!--What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? It's purpose is to help define and describe a meaning to the browser and for web developer. Which ones do you see as most useful? I think the Header Element is the most useful. Because thats where you want to put your logo. Header element usually gives the users an introductory of that content. It's the most important because it sets a theme and feel for the webpage.
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page? Normally most browser goes from top to bottom. A typical page structure will inlude a Header, Main contents, side bars, Navigation, and a footer.  In HTML5 structural elements inlucdes: Section, Article, Header and Footer, Nav, and aside.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? I learned about a new concept today, and that was through using Sublime Snippet. Makes it easier for me in the future when I have a complex code that I use often. I can simply use the trigger tag and it will automically lay the code structure out for me. I will most likely have a lot of sublime snippets in the future as I go deeper into my career as a software developer. 
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?  The most difficult challenge for me was building the table. I've successuly create a table for this challenege, however, I sometimes forget how the rowspan works. I'm currently using Code Academy, which is a great resource for me so far. It has a interactive feature that allows me to interact with HTML code. Helps me to engage and retain the new information more.-->
