# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? Version control systems are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.
* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master. As you start making commits, youâ€™re given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, it moves forward automatically.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? Commit is save change in your repository.  I would be detailed as possible on the steps and reason for the change.
* What is a merge conflict? Sometimes you get merge conflicts when merging or pulling from a branch. It also tells you to fix the conflicts and then to commit the result.  testing testing
